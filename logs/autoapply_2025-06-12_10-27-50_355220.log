        "Experience level not specified in resume"
    ]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the score: 0.7 indicates a good match, but not perfect. The match reasons highlight the strong technical skills match and remote work compatibility. The mismatch reasons highlight the missing experience with c++ and the lack of specified experience years in the resume.
